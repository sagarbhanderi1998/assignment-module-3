#  how will you create a dictionary using tuples in python?


=>  To convert a tuple to dictionary in Python, use the dict() method.
    The dict() function takes a tuple of tuples as an argument and
    returns the dictionary. Each tuple contains a key-value pair.

    example:-

    tup = ((11, "eleven"), (21, "mike"), (19, "dustin"), (46, "caleb"))
    print(tup)

    dct = dict((y, x) for x, y in tup)
    print(dct)
